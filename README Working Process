1. Cloned to my new Git Repository QUESTREPO.

2. Created a Dockerfile. Used Node:12
      Injected Enivornment variable ENV SECRET_WORD=Debug

3. Build Docker Image "imagequest". The output below appeared after running.
       Rearc quest listening on port 3000!

4. Registered Image to ECR. Tagged the version.

5. Created Cluster and Task Definition in ECS. 
      Container definition included port 3000

6. Run Service "ServiceQuest" and attached an ALB and autoscaling group.
     i.e configured security group to accecpt incoming traffic.

7. Created Cerificate in ACM, attched CName in Route 53.
	A-Routes Traffic to Application load balancer
	configured security group in Cluster to accept traffic.

SHORTCOMINGS.
Tried to inject the environment variable while the Container was running.
But that did not work with ECR.

Initially ran the container in docker. Created an instance and ssh (connected) to it.
But that didn't seen feasible, i.e for attaching an ALB and for scaling purposes.
Then tried ECS, which seemed better.

Tried both Fargate and EC2 mode. While using Fargate, the load balancer did not appear on the website.
Hence i used EC2 insatance.


Given More Time, i would try an use IAC to create ECS and have better documentation.
I would also try and customs the resources used for better performace.



Please find screenshots attached below and don't hesistate to connect me for further information.
Thank you.
